Version history:

3.0.1
-----
- Fixed negative cuepoints from common clip. Now these are properly propagated to the clips in playlist.
- buffering animation is now the same size as the play button overlay

3.0.0
-----
- Removed security errors that happened when loading images from foreign domains (domains other than the domain of the core SWF).
  Using a backgroundImage on canvas, in the content plugin, and for the controls is also possible to be loaded
  from a foreign domain - BUT backgroundRepeat cannot be used for foreign images.
- Now allows the embedding HTML to script the player even if the player is loaded from another domain.
- Added a 'live' property to Clips, used for live streams.
- A player embedded to a foreign domain now loads images, css files and other resources from the domain where the palyer SWF was loaded from. This is to generate shorter embed-codes.
- Added linkUrl and linkWindow properties to the logo, in commercial version you can set these to point to a linked page. The linked page gets opened
  when the logo is clicked.  Possible values for linkWindow:
    * "_self" specifies the current frame in the current window.
    * "_blank" specifies a new window.
    * "_parent" specifies the parent of the current frame.
    * "_top" specifies the top-level frame in the current window.
- Added linkUrl and linkWindow properties to clips. The linked page is opened when the video are is clicked and the corresponding clip has a linkUrl specified.
- Made the play button overlay and the "Play again" button slightly bigger.

RC4
---
- Now shows a "Play again" button at the end of the video/playlist
- Commercial version shows a Flowplayer logo if invalidKey was supplied, but the otherwise the player works
- setting play: null in configuration will disable the play button overlay
- setting opacity for "play" also sets it for the buffering animation
- Fixed firing of cuepoints too early. Cuepoint firing is now based on stream time and does not rely on timers
- added onXMPData event listener
- Should not stop playback too early before the clip is really completed
- The START event is now delayed so that the metadata is available when the event is fired, METADATA event was removed,
  new event BEGIN that is dispatched when the playback has been successfully started. Metadata is not normally
  available when BEGIN is fired. 

RC3
---
- stopBuffering() now dispatches the onStop event first if the player is playing/paused/buffering at the time of calling it
